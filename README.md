## About <a name = "about"></a>

inara.cz says it all.  Not sure what this is?  Hmmm... Come back when you do.  This thing does data analysis for the purpose of well... work it out.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Checkout the code and set-up your environment. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

See the requirements.txt file.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

In my environment, the threaded version runs about 25% faster than the non-threaded version.

There are two opportunities to use threading. Each "task" fetches data for one commodity at a time.  The data fetcher can also be made concurrent because it performs two tasks.
